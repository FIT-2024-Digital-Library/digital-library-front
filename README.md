## Description
It's a digital library project. 
Key Features still include the ability to add books to our library and automatically index them for future searches, so users will be able to quickly find what they need by title, author, genre—or even by citations from the book’s content. Additionally, our semantic search functionality will help users discover books on broader topics. And of course users can view books’ info.
Also, there were Additional Requirements to make the library more engaging and user-friendly. We made a Reviews section, allowing users to leave and view feedback on different books. And to make the user experience more appealing, we’ll provide multiple Display Templates, so admins can choose layouts that place covers and descriptions in different configurations.
Finally, we added collaborative book editing, so users are able to edit books with other users.
